<h1>What is gerrymandering?</h1>

<p>Gerrymandering is dividing a U.S. state into election districts in a way that gives one political party a majority in the districts while weakening the voting strength of the opposing party by concentrating as many opposing votes into as few districts as possible.</p>

<h2>Origin of Gerrymandering</h2>
<p>The term "gerrymandering" was created after the redrawing of Massachusetts district lines. After taking office in 1810, Governor Elbridge Gerry signed a bill to change district lines to benefit his Democratic-Republican party and weaken the Federalists. When mapped, the districts created a bizarre shape that resembled a salamander. The term is actually a combination of the governor's last name and the word "salamander." There is no solid evidence on who authored the term.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The goal of gerrymandering is to create districts that will win a party more seats in the legislature or protect the ones they currently have. Every 10 years after the census, new maps are drawn by the state legislator and then approved by the governor in most states.</p>

<h2>Gerrymandering Methods</h2>
<p>There are 2 main methods of gerrymandering: <span class='pack'>packing</span> and <span class='crack'>cracking</span>.</p>

<p><span class='pack'>Packing</span> is when redistricting tries to concentrate as many voters for one party into a single district to decrease its influence in other districts, reducing the number of potential district majorities.</p>

<p><span class='crack'>Cracking</span> is when redistricting tries to break apart a party majority by sectioning the votes into different districts, denying any chance of a winning party majority.</p>

<h2>Impacts of Gerrymandering</h2>
<p>Gerrymandering increases the number of safe seats, creating more possibilities for incumbents. This shifts the emphasis onto party representation and takes away the opportunity for the people to vote for their desired representative.</p>

<h2>Racial Gerrymandering</h2>
<p>Redistricting also dilutes minority votes and splits communities apart. Packing and cracking isolate or separate majority-minority groups, causing minority groups to become underrepresented in elections. Known as racial gerrymandering, historically maps have been drawn to ensure that whites win every district. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 made it illegal to redistrict based on race, however many Supreme Court cases in the '90s such as <i>Shaw v. Reno</i> and <i>Miller v. Johnson</i> have struck down attempts of racial gerrymandering to benefit minority groups.</p>

<h2>Increasing the Divide</h2>
<p>Gerrymandering can be encouraging hyper-partisanship. At the end of the day, giving the people pre-determined nominations rather than votes that count towards election shifts the focus onto party power rather than democracy power.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>What can we the people do to change the system? We can pass referenda for an independent, nonpartisan entity to handle gerrymandering instead of self-interested politicians. Referenda can also help with encouraging transparency within each state and hold elected officials accountable.</p>
